# Deep-Learning-Project-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Python
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9). The goal is to achieve 99% accuracy in classifying these digits.
